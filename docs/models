## UX storyboard:

### Customer:

#### Registration:
    Registration is implied by the project specification.
    Anonymous browsing is out of question.

    To aleviate the registration hurdle, a simplified customer registration
    process is available. Initially the user is required to input just the
    username, email and password.

    Once registered, the user can go ahead and browse the products before
    leaving additional information on the site.

    [Improvements]
    Further improvements could be made by making use of just the email, instead
    of both username and email requirements.

#### Checkout/Reservation:
    Once a reservation request is made, the customer must ensure that the
    remaining information is filled in.

#### Profile completion reminders:
    On the homepage, the customer should be reminded of the profile completion.



### Company:

### Registration:
    Provide full details about the company operations
